# Event-Based Testing

Event-Based Testing library for Android, for the second part of my master thesis: https://github.com/Simone3/Thesis

Include:

```groovy
<action> 'it.polimi.testing:event-based-testing:1.2'
```

Where
```groovy
<action>
```
Can be:
```groovy
compile
```
```groovy
testCompile
```
```groovy
androidTestCompile
```
Depending on what you want.
